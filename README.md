# Machine Learning with Python (Coursera)

## 6. Hierarchical clustering
An application of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (bottom up approach).

## 7. Density-Based Clustering
Density-based Clustering locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. Density, in this context, is defined as the number of points within a specified radius. In this lab, the main focus will be manipulating the data and properties of DBSCAN and observing the resulting clustering. 

## 8. Content-based Filtering movies
A recommender system based on the principle: "show me more of the same I liked before".

## 9. Collaborative Filtering movies
A recommender system based on similar users' preferences.

## 10. The best classifier
Final project of the course 'Machine Learning with Python'.

In this project, I build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. I load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. 

Models applied:

* k-Nearest Neighbour

* Decision Tree

* Support Vector Machine

* Logistic Regression

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

* Jaccard index

* F1-score

* LogLoass
