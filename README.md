# Machine Learning with Python (Coursera)
This course dives into the basics of machine learning using Python.

## Regression
Simple, multiple, polynomial and non-linear regressions.

## Classification
KNN, decision trees, logostic regression and SVM.

## Clustering
K-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering (bottom up approach) and density-based.

## Recommender systems 
Collaborative filtering (based on similar users' preferences) and content-nased.

## The best classifier
Final project of the course 'Machine Learning with Python'.

In this project, I build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. I load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. 

Models applied:

* k-Nearest Neighbour

* Decision Tree

* Support Vector Machine

* Logistic Regression

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

* Jaccard index

* F1-score

* LogLoass
