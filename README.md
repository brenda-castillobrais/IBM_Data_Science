# The_best_classifier
In this project, I build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

I load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. 

Models applied:

* k-Nearest Neighbour

* Decision Tree

* Support Vector Machine

* Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

* Jaccard index

* F1-score

* LogLoass
